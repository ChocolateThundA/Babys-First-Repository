[Here](https://github.com/ChocolateThundA/Babys-First-Repository/blob/master/README.md "this webpage inside of GitHub")  
[Webpage](https://ChocolateThundA.github.io/Babys-First-Repository/ "this as a webpage")  
[Repository](https://github.com/ChocolateThundA/Babys-First-Repository "the repository this page is in")  
## In this page I will
- make an unnumbered list  
- include an image  

I could include an image of  
1. a giraffe
1. not a giraffe  

## Do you want some code, because if so, I can write it!
```java
system.out.print("Hello World");
```

## I can also make images
